    <h1 ><em><u>ABOUT ME</u></em></h1>



<img src="images\ddddd.png" alt="">
    <p class="C">I grew up in a close-knit family in Narayanganj. Although I moved to Dhaka at a very young age to study.<br>
      Even though I am not an introvert, I sometimes act like  introverted for the sake of argument. People can easily believe me.<br>
       I like to listen to everyone's story and if possible, I also help. I like to have a look at nature, I like to read books,<br>
        I like to chat with friends. Any food attracts me in a special way but the special weakness towards biryani and burgers always works.<br>
         The worst part of me is that I can't say no to people. And the good side is I can mix with all kinds of people.I am not judgemmental.<br>
       i believe </<u><b><em>LIFE IS NOTHING HAD TO COLLECT SOME HAPPY OR SAD MOMENT</em> </b></u><br>
     That is why i like to keep memories as much as i can .Like everyone my aim also to be succesfull in life but i havee a hidden  <br>
     dream you can say it my dream project is to establish an old age home as well as serve my country .i also believe in Takdir(karma )</p>
